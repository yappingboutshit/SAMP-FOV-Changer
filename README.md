### [Quick Testament for my love]
In the soft hush of night, when the world forgets to watch,
I whisper secrets to the stars—secrets I’ve hidden from you.

This one is strange. Tender. Real.

I’ve always tried to belong in your world,
To be your calm in the storm,
But in the quiet, I’ve wandered…

And found myself drawn to a different rhythm—
One of fur, of fang, of something older than words.
I like therians.
Not as a fetish or fascination—
But because I envy their honesty,
The way they wear their wildness
Without apology.

I feared you'd laugh. Or worse, feel betrayed.
But truth is love’s last gift, even if it trembles.

I don’t ask for understanding. Only that you know.
I still love you. Fiercely, gently, always.
This is just another piece of me—howling in the dark.
